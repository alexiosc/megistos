# This is a Megistos translation table.  Anything to the *RIGHT* of the first
# hash (#) character in a line is a comment. 256 translations are given, one
# for each of the possible character values. The format of the file is:
#
#
# translation_for_character_000
# translation_for_character_001
# : : :
# translation_for_character_255
#
# translation_for_character may be either:
#    * a hexadecimal value in the form xx (00 to ff). ALWAYS specify
#      both digits. Pad with 0 if necessary.
#    * a character value EXCEPT white space (tabs, newlines, spaces) and the
#      backslash (\). ALWAYS specify single characters (obviously).
#
# In order to specify white space, specify the character's hexadecimal ASCII
# code. To specify the hash (#), use its hexadecimal ASCII value (23).
#
# White space is ignored, but we've organised the translation table as a
# 16x16 matrix for obvious reasons.
#
# To leave a character untranslated, specify \000. Obviously, \000 is always
# untranslated (why would you want to translate THAT?).


# PURPOSE: Translate Latin-1/ISO-8859-1 to 7-bit US-ASCII.
#
# KBDXLATION: Since the user is assumed to be unable to type non-ASCII
# characters, a suitable reverse (kbdxlation) mapping would be 1--to--1.
