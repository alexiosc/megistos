(a) Files under this directory are usually small. For best results, mount a
    filesystem with smaller block sizes than ext2 FS. (eg 512 bytes -- minix
    FS with 30 byte filenames).

(b) Hard links are formed under this directory. Please keep all
    subdirectories in the same filesystem or the system will fail in various
    ways.
