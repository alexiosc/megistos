	This is the statistics module.

There are three basic types of classes:
	options
	sex
	age

These classes can be classified to four categories:
	options
	options vs. sex
	options vs. age
	options vs. sex vs. age

(Special care has been taken for the combo questions where exists one more
category, that concerns the choice)

o  Only select and combo questions are reported.

o  Text and number questions will not generate any report. Their commentation
   is left to the sysop.

There are two different types of arrays: Tables and Graphics.
Graphics are a representation of the Table arrays. A table contains only
values and percents on total (or partial totals) at each combination.




The module needs an external data file to work. The file is named
`default.tem' for the time. This file contains prompt templates for the
table and graphic arrays. The contents of the file will be transformed into
their binary representation when the prompts are stablized. This will be the
default data. An external file could also be available to use, in order to
override the default prompts.
