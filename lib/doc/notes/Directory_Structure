Megistos Directory Structure

    Megistos  0.99 followed  a  bizarre  structure based  on  a hardwired  root
directory  that included  source code,  object code,  executables and  BBS data
files. This meant  a separate installation and compilation  was needed for each
BBS served on a machine.

Starting with Megistos 1.0, we've moved to a Debian Policy-compliant structure,
which incidentally is  the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)  version 2.1. We
have the following bits of data to sort into directories:

  * Source code
  * Development files
  * Libraries
  * BBS-Specific object code
  * System-wide binaries (things that non-BBS users should be able to use)
  * Instance-specific data trees

Here is the proposed directory structure, assuming a prefix of /usr:

     (Parenthesised  acronym  legend:  AI  =  Architecture  Independent,  AD  =
     Architecture Dependent, NW = Network-wide  (shareable), L = Local -- these
     follow the FHS)

/etc/megistos:

	Global configuration (L).

/etc/megistos/instance/$BBSCODE:

	Configuration for BBS $BBSCODE (symlinked from
	/var/lib/megistos/$BBSCODE/etc) (L)

/usr/bin:

	BBS Binaries needed globally (such as megistos-config etc) (AD,NW).

/usr/lib:

	Megistos shared and static libraries (libmegistos) (AD,NW).

/usr/lib/megistos:

	Top-level  library/binary directory (AD,NW).  Architecture independent,
	network-exportable. Under which are directories such as:

	/usr/lib/megistos/bin:

		Binaries needed internally by the BBS.

	/usr/lib/megistos/plugins:

		Plugin object code.

	/usr/lib/megistos/virgin:

		The  `virgin'  instance. This  includes  an uninstantiated  BBS
		skeleton that is  copied to /var/lib/megistos/$BBSCODE create a
		new  system  called  $BBSCODE.  It should  optimally  be  under
		/usr/share/megistos, but is currently architecture dependent so
		this is impossible.

/usr/share/doc/megistos:

	All documentation. (AI,NW).

/var/lib/megistos/$BBSCODE:

	This where  data for the BBS  called $BBSCODE lies. It  follows the old
	Megistos 0.99 $PREFIX/data structure.  Directories like lib and bin are
	symlinked from /usr/lib/megistos/{lib,bin}. (AD,L)



The Strange And Terrifying Story of msgidx.

    Msgidx  reads  configuration  and  message  block files  (.msg  files)  and
converts them into binary  configuration/message blocks (.mbk). For the benefit
of the programmer, it  also outputs a C header file (.h)  with indices into the
.mbk file #define'd for easier access.

This was built to mirror the Major BBS  utility of the same name, so as to port
our .msg files from Major to  Megistos with minimal hassle. In the process, the
two formats have grown apart and I doubt they're even compatible now.

Now, the Major BBS used a mostly flat directory structure. Megistos follows the
FHS, so files must go to the right place.

As of Megistos version 1.0.2, Msgidx follows this algorithm:

   (a) if run within the source tree, it assumes .h files are needed to compile
       the system and thus leaves them in the current directory. .mbk files are
       copied over to the virgin/lib/mbk directory.

       Header    files   generated    from   msgidx    are    installed   under
       $prefix/include/megistos/mbk.  Compiled  message  blocks  are  installed
       under $prefix/lib/megistos/virgin.

   (b) if  run within a BBS instance,  header files are not  generated, but are
       checked  against the  system-wide version  and  an error  is emitted  if
       differences  are  encountered. This  forces  the  file  structure to  be
       identical so the binaries can work  with the .mbk files. MBK files go to
       /var/lib/megistos/$BBSCODE/data/msgs.

The detection works by checking if (a) $VIRGINDIR is set and points to a
directory (set by the Makefiles in the source tree) or (b) $BBSCODE is set
(this is done by the system itself and also by the Makefile in
/var/lib/$BBSCODE/etc/prompts).

If no positive identification of either case (a) or (b) is found, an error is
issued.
