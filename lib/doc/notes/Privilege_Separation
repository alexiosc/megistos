Privilege Separation notes


Version 0.

Originally, Megistos generated one UNIX user account per BBS user. Our
original BBS allowed certain trusted users to use a somewhat
restricted UNIX shell (to get acquainted with *nixes etc).

There was a bbs user and bbs group (to which all users belonged). All
BBS files belonged to group bbs, and had a umask of at least 007 so no
other group could access the BBS.

This was an accounting and security nightmare (and ls(1) started
taking far too long to map UIDs to usernames), so it was discontinued.


Version 1.

In version 1, there were just two users, bbs, and one group of the
same name. Users weren't allowed to go anywhere near the shell (with
the exception of a few admins who needed this). All BBS users used the
same UNIX UID, bbsuser:bbs. Directories again belonged to bbs:bbs, and
a umask of at least 007 was used.


Version 2.

This was dictated by the need to run elegantly at least two different
BBSs on the same system.

There is one top-level user, megistos:megistos that owns the library
directory and top-level instance directory (/var/lib/megistos). The
top-level directory has 754 permissions.

There is one second-level user per instance, $INSTANCE:$INSTANCE that
owns the instance under /var/lib/megistos/$INSTANCE. User $INSTANCE
also belongs to the megistos group (in /etc/groups). The
/var/lib/megistos/$INSTANCE directory has 750 permissions.

There is one third-level user per instance, $INSTANCE-userr:$INSTANCE,
that corresponds to the version 1 bbsuser and owns any user-generated
files.

Assuming INSTANCE=acro, here is what this setup could look like:

$ INSTANCE=acro
$ id megistos; id $INSTANCE; id ${INSTANCE}-user
uid=102(megistos) gid=101(megistos) groups=101(megistos)
uid=106(acro) gid=114(acro) groups=114(acro),101(megistos)
uid=113(acro-user) gid=114(acro) groups=114(acro)

And the directory structure of /var/lib/megistos could look something
like this (this only showcases the ownership and permissions, NOT the
directory structure under /var/lib/megistos/$INSTANCE.

$ find /var/lib/megistos -ls
 62604    4 drwxr-x--x   3 megistos megistos     4096 Feb  7 12:43 /var/lib/megistos/
 78243    4 drwxr-x---   3 acro     acro         4096 Feb  7 12:51 /var/lib/megistos/acro
 78244    0 -rw-------   1 acro     acro            0 Feb  7 12:39 /var/lib/megistos/acro/private-file
 78245    0 -rw-r-----   1 acro     acro            0 Feb  7 12:39 /var/lib/megistos/acro/semiprivate-file
 78246    4 -rw-rw----   1 acro     acro          335 Feb  7 12:43 /var/lib/megistos/acro/public-file
156492    4 drwxrwx---   2 acro     acro         4096 Feb  7 12:51 /var/lib/megistos/acro/public-dir
156494    4 -rw-r-----   1 acro-use acro          403 Feb  7 12:51 /var/lib/megistos/acro/public-dir/user-generated-file
