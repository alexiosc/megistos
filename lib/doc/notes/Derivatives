This is a (possibly incomplete) list of free software that is included
in this distribution as either derived software or repackaged
software:



src/system/daemons/emud: DERIVED from ttysnoop, although it has
changed drastically since 1994.

src/system/bbsgetty: DERIVED from the Linux version of getty that came
with Slackware Linux in 1994; has since been rewritten almost from
scratch.

src/system/protocols/lrzsz: REPACKAGED from the Slackware lrzsz
distribution. This is GPLed software.
