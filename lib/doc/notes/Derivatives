This is a (possibly incomplete) list of free software that is included
in this distribution as either derived software or repackaged
software:



src/system/daemons/emud: DERIVED from ttysnoop, although it has
changed drastically since 1994.

src/system/bbsgetty: DERIVED from the Linux version of getty that came
with Slackware Linux in 1994; has since been rewritten almost from
scratch.

src/system/protocols/rzsz: originally a REPACKAGED lrzsz distribution,
dropped because of licensing restrictions and replaced by the lrzsz
distribution, which is GPLed software. Since Megistos 1.0.2, lrzsz is
no longer included in Megistos. A 'Recommends' dependency on the
package is declared instead.
