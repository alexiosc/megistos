 Credits are purchased by users to permit them "live"
 connect time on The Major BBS.  They are consumed,
 typically, at the rate of 1 per minute.  You may
 change this value to adjust the default "cost" to
 users of using your system. Please note that the 
 consumption unit is credits per 100 minutes, not
 credits per minute! So, for the standard charge of
 1 credit/min, you should fill in this field with
 the value '100' (100 creds/100 mins, 1 cred/min)
