#
# <type>: the type of the action verb. The following types are supported:
#
#         S = Simple. The action consists of a simple message sent to all
#             users in the channel. Examples are 'faint', 'giggle', 'hide':
#             verbs that don't need another user as an object. Only
#             <user-message>, and <simple-message> need to be specified.
#             <user-message> is sent to the user who performed the action;
#             <simple-message> is is sent to all others in the channel.
#
#         O = Object. The action needs a user as an object. Alternatively,
#             'all' or 'everyone' may be specified, in which case the
#             action is directed to all users. 'Secretly' may be asserted
#             instead of 'all' or 'everyone'; the action will then be sent to
#             the object user ONLY. <user-message> is sent to the user who
#             performed the action. <other-message> is broadcast to the
#             channel if the object of the action is another user. The object/
#             target user gets a special version of the message, residing in
#             <target-message>. If the object is 'all' or 'everyone',
#             <all-message> is broadcast instead. Finally, if the 'secretly'
#             option is used, nothing is broadcast to the channel, and the
#             object user receives <secret-message> instead of
#             <target-message>. Examples of this action type are 'admire',
#             'handshake', 'hit' and 'kick': verbs that NEED an object.
#
#         D = Double. This is a combination of Simple and Object type
#             actions. If the action is specified without an object,
#             <simple-message> is broadcast to the users. If an object IS
#             specified, the action works just like an O type action and
#             needs the same strings. Examples of this action type are
#             'bow', 'clap' and 'curse': verbs with optional objects.
#
#         A = Adverb. This is used to qualify what a user says. Examples of
#             this type are 'ask', 'beg', 'chant', 'cheer' and 'yell': verbs
#             that are used to add a quality to what a user says, but may
#             also be used by themselves. To achieve this, <simple-message>
#             is broadcast to all users if nothing follows the action. If
#             the user writes something like 'yell BE QUIET!', the user's
#             message ('BE QUIET!') is broadcast to the users as usual,
#             but following the contents of <adverb-message>. Note that in
#             this case, the 'user' string isn't broadcast to the performer
#             of the action -- the hard-wired message is always used. Our
#             example might be broadcast as 'Sysop [yelling]: BE QUIET!',
#             where <adverb-message> is '[yelling]'.
#
#         G = Generic (k.o.g.a. style). This is the most generic verb style
#             of all. This message only uses the optional
#             <user-message> and <generic-message> which is printed
#             before the rest of the action is shown. For example,
#             using standard Megistos substitution variables, we could
#             define the famous KOGA action's <generic-message> as
#             simply '@USERID@' (English version). Then, when the user
#             writes 'KOGA just sits here and watches.', the system
#             will print the two strings together (doing variable
#             substitutions as usual), and end up with a line like
#             this: 'Sysop just sits here and watches.'. This is a
#             very powerful sort of action. Using the 'access' field is
#             recommended to control who is allowed to use actions of
#             this type.
#
# <action-name>: the string used to kick off this action. Only single
#                words are allowed (i.e. no white space). Try not to
#                make the name of the action conflict with any other
#                teleconference commands (e.g. CHAT), or you'll have
#                an inaccessible action verb.
#
# <user-message>: this message is sent to the user who issued the
#                 action as an acknowledgement. It is not obligatory to
#                 include it, but is strongly recommended for action
#                 types S, O, D (hmm... just realised what the types
#                 spell out :-) ). If it's not specified, a fall-back
#                 hard-wired message will be used instead. You can
#                 have more than one 'user' keywords in a single verb
#                 definition. Each line defines the user message for
#                 a different language (the first one defines it for
#                 language #1, the second for #2, etc). You should
#                 have one 'user' line for each supported language.
#                 If you don't, the last defined one is used (e.g.
#                 if a message isn't defined for language #3, we'll
#                 use the one for language #2; if THAT isn't defined,
#                 we'll use language #1. If that isn't defined either,
#                 we'll fallback to the hard-wired message mentioned
#                 earlier).
#
# <simple-message>: This is REQUIRED by and ONLY ALLOWED with types S,
#                   D and A. See the explanation of each type for
#                   details on how this message is used. You may have
#                   multiple 'simple' keywords in the definition to
#                   allow the definition of multilingual actions. See
#                   <user-message> for the operation of the multi-
#                   lingual feature of the definitions.
#
# <other-message>: This is REQUIRED by and ONLY ALLOWED with types O
#                  and D. Same as before for multiple language support.
#
# <all-message>: This is REQUIRED by and ONLY ALLOWED with types O
#                and D. Same as before for multiple language support.
#
# <target-message>: This is REQUIRED by and ONLY ALLOWED with types O
#                   and D. Same as before for multiple language support.
#
# <secret-message>: This is REQUIRED by and ONLY ALLOWED with types O
#                   and D. Same as before for multiple language support.
#
# <adverb-message>: This is REQUIRED by and ONLY ALLOWED with type A.
#                   Same as before for multiple language support.
#
# <generic-message>: This is REQUIRED by and ONLY ALLOWED with type G.
#                    Same as before for multiple language support.
#
# <user-ID>: This restricts the use of this action to the users whose
#            user IDs are listed (separated by spaces) here. You may
#            use multiple 'access' keywords if one line isn't enough
#            to list all user IDs, but if that is the case I suggest
#            using a KEY to lock the action and giving that key to
#            those users who should have the action.
#
# <key-number>: Specify a number from 0 to 129 here. This will lock the
#               action, only allowing users with the specified key to
#               use it. Key 0 means 'unlocked' (this is the default case,
#               so your 'key' line is redundant!). Keys 1-128 are the
#               usual 128 Megistos BBS keys. Key 129 is possessed by the
#               user ID 'Sysop' alone. If both KEY and ACCESS are specified,
#               the system performs an AND action to check if someone has
#               access to an action. Privileged users automatically have
#               access to all actions.
#
# There, that's it with the format. I mentioned substitution variables
# before. The following substitution variables will be used (most, marked
# with (*) are for non-English languages):
#
# @USERID@     The userID of the user performing the action
# @USRCOL@     This user's teleconference colour
# @ARTNOM@     Nominative article for this user's sex (*)
# @ARTGEN@     Genitive article for this user's sex (*)
# @ARTDAT@     Dative article for this user's sex (*)
# @ARTACC@     Accusative article for this user's sex (*)
# @OTHUID@     The userID of the object/target-user
# @OTHCOL@     That user's teleconference colour
# @OTHNOM@     Nominative article for that user's sex (*)
# @OTHGEN@     Genitive article for that user's sex (*)
# @OTHDAT@     Dative article for that user's sex (*)
# @OTHACC@     Accusative article for that user's sex (*)
#
# Grammar explanations (again, most of these variables aren't
# used for English where such things as articles aren't (mostly)
# dependent on the gender of the noun).
#
# Nominative is used with the object of the sentence.
# Genitive is used when referring to something belonging to someone
# (e.g. German Genitiv, Greek Geniki). Dative is used when, e.g.
# attributing something to someone (not very usual -- used in
# German as Dativ, in ancient Greek as Dotike). Accusative is
# generously used when we're talking about an object, transferring
# action TO someone (German Akkusativ, Greek Aitiatike). 
#
# Those should be enough to define even the most exotic action.
# You can also use the rest of the Megistos BBS actions if you
# want to leave the exotic and move on to the downright strange. :-)
