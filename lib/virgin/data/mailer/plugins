# offline.mail is a special plugin in that it's required by every
# other plugin. It should never be disabled and should always be the
# first one to run. It's also the request manager, i.e. it has the
# authority to add requests to the request DB for other plugins to
# read and process. When uploading, it's called twice (one at the
# beginning of the processing; one at the end) to clear out any
# remaining unsatisfied requests.
