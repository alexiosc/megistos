megistos (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added first draft of a megistos-config script to yield
    compiler/linking options and directories for compiling further source
    code.
  * Beautified code, added documentation to numerous objects, and converted
    existing doc++ documentation to doxygen format.
  * Added I18N to the code so that the few (14 as of last count) strings
    in the Megistos library can be translated without the need for kludgy
    #defines.
  * Added documentation directory to Makefile.am and ensured full
    documentation (including manpages) is included in libmegistos-dev.
  * Introduced libtool's libltdl to handle dynamically loaded modules
    (currently only global command handlers).
  * Restructured source tree to rationalise build. Removed old Makefiles
    in favour of one simple Makefile.am per sub-project.
  * Added new functionality to megistos-config to aid in development and
    modernisation of packages.
  * Added documentation about the new standards-compliant directory
    structure.
  * Added documentation about packages derived from others.
  * Dropped last remnants of the rzsz distribution.
  * Updated msgidx to support the new directory hierarchy and to support
    rebuilding message block files without the source being present (or
    writeable).
  * Ran indent(1) on all code.
  * Updated #include directives to use the new directory structure and to
    decrease ambiguities with other header files.
  * Wrote a hierarchy of Automake templates to facilitate building
    different components of the system (daemons, unix programs, BBS
    programs, modules, file transport protocols, global command handlers,
    et cetera).
  * Made a library of the common club functionality (clubhdr, and later
    perhaps clubax too).
  * Similarly, a library of common teleconference functionality that is
    needed to build third party plugins.
  * Yet again, another library was made of common mailer functionality
    that is needed by most mailer plugins.
