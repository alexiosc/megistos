megistos (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added first draft of a megistos-config script to yield
    compiler/linking options and directories for compiling further source
    code.
  * Beautified code, added documentation to numerous objects, and converted
    existing doc++ documentation to doxygen format.
  * Added I18N to the code so that the few (14 as of last count) strings
    in the Megistos library can be translated without the need for kludgy
    #defines.
  * Added documentation directory to Makefile.am and ensured full
    documentation (including manpages) is included in libmegistos-dev.
  * Introduced libtool's libltdl to handle dynamically loaded modules
    (currently only global command handlers).
  * Restructured source tree to rationalise build. Removed old Makefiles
    in favour of one simple Makefile.am per sub-project.
