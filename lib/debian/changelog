megistos (1.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed email addresses and URLs.
  * Rebuilt CVS repository after near-catastrophic disk crash, stepped all
    versions as a result.

megistos (1.0.11) unstable; urgency=medium

    gzipview, uudecode and remove and view-and-remove.
  * Added protocol-script template to accommodate protocols built as
    scripts.

megistos (1.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closed SF bug 957531: changing club access levels for certain users
    causes the emailclubs module to crash.

megistos (1.0.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Closed SF bug 958385: users not being deleted during cleanup. Fixed by
    reincorporating the missingg 'bbsuserdel' script into the
    distribution.
  * Worked around TERMIOS issue with vised: NL/CR translations not set properly.
  * Worked around identical TERMIOS issue with bbsdialog (field help).

megistos (1.0.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Coded a candidate fix for a minor bug in src/system/daemons/emud.c to
    ensure ${instance}/etc/.emu-* files have appropriate permissions and
    ownership.
  * Closed SF bug 957526: remote sysop command 'emulate' not working due
    to permissions problem in ${instance}/etc/.emu-*.

 -- Alexios Chouchoulas <alexios@bedroomlan.org>  Sat, 22 May 2004 00:55:25 +0100

megistos (1.0.8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Closed SF bug 420423: verified as closed (actual bug fix was much
    earlier). If a user issues a global /r command (view registry) for an
    inexistent user, the system replies with &quot;November&quot;.
  * Closed SF bug 229615: verified as closed (actual bug fix was much
    earlier). This referred to signup not working.
  * Closed SF bug 957524: cleanup not being done. Fixed by reinstated the
    bbscleanup script that had previously gone (inexplicably) missing.
  * Numerous instances of hardwired references to the UID:GID pair
    'bbs:bbs' changed to use the instance UID:GID pair. Likely to fix
    several insidious permission-oriented bugs.
  * Fixed numerous instances of system calls like chown(2) and chmod(2)
    being idiotically executed by running system(3) with appropriate
    command strings.

megistos (1.0.7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Closed SF bug 954250: Uploads disabled. Caused by segfault in
    src/tools/updown/upload.c (and, by symmetry, also download.c -- although no
    report of the latter function crashing has been given and it could not be
    reproduced).
  * Fixed the magic file path in bbs.session.
  * Closed SF bug 430829: buffer overrun in the registry fixed (it overflowed
    into the Menuman data structures and messed up the user's location when
    they were editing their registry entry).

 -- Alexios Chouchoulas <alexios@bedroomlan.org>  Mon, 17 May 2004 15:38:05 +0300

megistos (1.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lack of terminating NUL in src/modules/emailclubs/reply.c made it
    impossible to save replies to club messages because the command line
    was mangled.

 -- Alexios Chouchoulas <alexios@bedroomlan.org>  Thu, 13 May 2004 18:21:56 +0300

megistos (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug in signup that caused a segmentation fault when a password
    was generated.
  * Made signup not ask for a language, encoding and ANSI setting if these
    questions have already been asked by bbslogin prior to displaying the
    login prompt.

 -- Alexios Chouchoulas <alexios@bedroomlan.org>  Wed,  5 May 2004 12:22:59 +0300

megistos (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=critical

  * More bug fixes in libmegistos/prompts.c, this time to do with the
    prompt block indexes when accessing the last message in a block.
  * Fixed CVS tree structure and tagged.

 -- Alexios Chouchoulas <alexios@bedroomlan.org>  Mon,  3 May 2004 09:07:29 +0300

megistos (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=critical

  * Fixed bug whereby bbsd used msg_sys without opening the block.
  * Added safeguards in libmegistos/prompts.c against that happening again.
  * First vestiges of UNIX98 PTY handling (pathetic for now).
  * Prompt blocks are now loaded into memory to avoid issues with file
    index corruption.
  * Fixed insidious little bug in libmegistos/prompts.c that would always
    load 8191 bytes from a prompt block regardless of the size
    requested. D'oh!

 -- Alexios Chouchoulas <alexios@bedroomlan.org>  Sun,  2 May 2004 14:34:07 +0300

megistos (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added first draft of a megistos-config script to yield
    compiler/linking options and directories for compiling further source
    code.
  * Beautified code, added documentation to numerous objects, and converted
    existing doc++ documentation to doxygen format.
  * Added I18N to the code so that the few (14 as of last count) strings
    in the Megistos library can be translated without the need for kludgy
    #defines.
  * Added documentation directory to Makefile.am and ensured full
    documentation (including manpages) is included in libmegistos-dev.
  * Introduced libtool's libltdl to handle dynamically loaded modules
    (currently only global command handlers).
  * Restructured source tree to rationalise build. Removed old Makefiles
    in favour of one simple Makefile.am per sub-project.
  * Added new functionality to megistos-config to aid in development and
    modernisation of packages.
  * Added documentation about the new standards-compliant directory
    structure.
  * Added documentation about packages derived from others.
  * Dropped last remnants of the rzsz distribution.
  * Updated msgidx to support the new directory hierarchy and to support
    rebuilding message block files without the source being present (or
    writeable).
  * Ran indent(1) on all code.
  * Updated #include directives to use the new directory structure and to
    decrease ambiguities with other header files.
  * Wrote a hierarchy of Automake templates to facilitate building
    different components of the system (daemons, unix programs, BBS
    programs, modules, file transport protocols, global command handlers,
    et cetera).
  * Made a library of the common club functionality (clubhdr, and later
    perhaps clubax too).
  * Similarly, a library of common teleconference functionality that is
    needed to build third party plugins.
  * Yet again, another library was made of common mailer functionality
    that is needed by most mailer plugins.
  * Transferred the build to a faster machine, whereupon several build
    blunders were discovered (because I had to be lazy with full builds
    before -- Megistos takes a long time to build on a K6-233 with 128
    megs of RAM.
  * Reincorporated documentation.
  * Started work on the instance framework.
  * The virgin instance now installed in ${prefix}/lib/megistos/virgin.
  * Started using debconf for the configuration questions.
  * Added megistos-admin script to manage BBS instances.
  * Numerous changes in virgin/etc/rc.bbs to account for the new directory
    infrastructure, for enhanced portability, and the like.
  * Moved daemon PID files from ${instancedir}/etc to ${instancedir}/run.
  * Completely rewrote privilege separation framework.
  * Documented reworked privilege separation in
    doc/notes/Privilege_Separation.
  * Much of the BBS instance directory structure has changed significantly
    as a result of changes to the source tree, and the implementation of
    the instance infrastructure.
  * Numerous changes in the library and daemons to fix permissions,
    ownerships et cetera when installing a BBS from scratch.
  * More bug fixes than I can remember. Almost all of them had to do with
    directories not existing in the virgin instance, and/or file
    permissions not set up correctly.
  * Bug fix: removed spurious fclose() in src/modules/telecon/accesses.c
    that would cause crashes when entering club teleconference channels.
  * Bug fix: removed mod_done() call from src/modules/telecon/plugins.c
    that would mangle TERMIOS when a plugins was called.
