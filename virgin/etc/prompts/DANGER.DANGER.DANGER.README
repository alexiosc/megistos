Script RELINK:

This script will re-make symlinks to all your .msg files under /usr/local/bbs.

WARNING!!! IT WILL DO THIS BY FIRST *REMOVING* ALL .msg FILES THAT
           ARE SYMLINKS TO OTHER FILES.

           DO *NOT* STORE other files in this directory. Instead use
           RELINK (or, better, make depend) to do the job automatically.

RELINK is called by make using the respective Makefile (target dep or
depend).
