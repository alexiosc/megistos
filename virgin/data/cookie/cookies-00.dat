#FEATURE n.:
   1. A surprising property of a program.  Occasionally documented.
      To call a property a feature sometimes means the author of the

      makes an unexpected, although not strictly speaking an incorrect
      response.  See BUG.  "That's not a bug, that's a feature!"
      A bug can be changed to a feature by documenting it.
   2. A well-known and beloved property; a facility.  Sometimes features
      are planned, but are called crocks by others.

#SIMPLE:
     SIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming
   Linguistic Environment. This language was developed at the
   Hannover College for Technological Misfits, was designed to make
   it impossible to write code with errors in it. The statements are,
   therefore, confined to BEGIN, END and STOP. No matter how you
   arrange the statements, you can't make a syntax error.
     Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful. Thus, they achieve
   the results of the programs written in other languages without the
   tedious, frustrating process of testing and debugging.

#SLOBOL:
   SLOBOL is best known for the speed, or lack of it, of its compiler.
   Although newest compilers allow you to take a coffee break while
   they compile, most SLOBOL compilers allow you to travel to Bolivia
   to pick the coffee... Forty-three programmers are known to have
   died of boredom sitting at their terminals while waiting for a
   SLOBOL program to compile. Weary SLOBOL programmers often turn to
   a related (but infinitely faster) language, COCAINE.

#LAIDBACK:
     Historically, VALGOL is a derivative of LAIDBACK, which was
   developed at the (now defunct) Marine County Center for T'ai Chi,
   Mellowness and Computer Programming, as an alternative to the more
   intense atmosphere in nearby Silicon Valley.
     The center was ideal for programmers who like to soak in hot tubs
   while they worked. Unfortunately, few programmers could survive there
   for long, since the center outlawed pizza and RC Cola in favor of
   bean curd and Perrier.
     Many mourn the demise of LAIDBACK because of its reputation as a
   gentle and nonthreatening language. For example, LAIDBACK responded to
   syntax errors with the message, SORRY MAN, I CAN'T DEAL BEHIND THAT.

#SARTRE:
   Named after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely
   unstructured language. Statements in SARTRE have no purpose; they
   just are. Thus SARTRE programmers are left to define their own
   functions. SARTRE programmers tend to be boring and depressed and
   are no fun at parties.

#C- :
   This language was named for the grade received by its creator
   when he submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming
   class. C- is best described as a "low level" programming language.
   In fact, the language generally requires more C- statements than
   machine-code statements to execute a given task. In this respect,
   it is very similar to COBOL.
@from the Almanac of Obscure Programming Languages
#LITHP:

#VALGOL:
     From its modest beginnings in Southern California's San Fernando
   Valley, VALGOL is enjoying a dramatic surge of popularity across the
   industry. VALGOL commands include REALLY, LIKE, WELL, and Y*KNOW.
   Variables are assigned with the =LIKE and =TOTALLY operators. Other
   operators include the California Booleans, FERSURE and NOWAY.
   Repetitions of code are handled in FOR - SURE loops. Here is a sample
   VALGOL program:
                      LIKE Y*KNOW (I MEAN) START
                      IF PIZZA =LIKE BITCHEN AND
                  B =LIKE TUBULAR AND
                  C =LIKE GRODY**MAX
                      THEN
                  FOR I =LIKE 1 TO OH MAYBE 100

#FIFTH:
   FIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types
   refer to quantity. The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and
   JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and
   BLOTTO. Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,
   CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.

   The many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and
   financial status of its users. Commands in the ELITE dialect include
   VSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH
   and RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers
   who end up using this language.

#DOGO:
   Developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Obedience Training,
   DOGO heralds a new era of computer-literate pets. DOGO commands

   leaves a deposit as he travels across the screen.

#An announcement from BytePac Inc. (and ByteUnPac Inc.):

We have just made available to the market our latest and most advanced
packing algorithm. Its operation is based on the following process:

Pack the file(s) with Huffman code. Now you have got a packed file.
Remove all instances of binary-zero. For example: '00110011' => '1111'
This is ok, since binary-zero is meaningless.

Now, what have you got? A file which is one long binary string of '1's.
This long binary-string is possible to pack into one bit, which means
that it is possible to pack eight files into one (8-bit) byte.

(There is only one problem: An algorithm to unpack the byte is not yet
available, but we are working on it. A tough job, but we will not give
up so easily)

#Announcement from FutureByte Inc. (this is a payed commercial)

We are now in a position to offer to the market a revolutionary new
product. A Crystal Ball Interface. The idea is that you hook a crystal
ball (you know, the kind of thing fortune tellers stare into) on to your
computer through an RS232 interface or an Ethernet connection. This
device can be used for all kinds of wonderful things:

 Ideal for virtual memory implementation. No more "swap out the least
  recently used page". Instead let the crystal ball tell the operating
  system which page exactly is not going to be used within the next X
  minutes, and the system can then swap that page out.
 Improved shutdown facility. Let the system perform an orderly shutdown
  2 minutes before a power failure or system crash.
 Improved backup. The backup utility need only copy the files that you
  are actually going to need again.
 Write-ahead. Not just type-ahead. Let the computer perform the next
  write statement before it is actually executed.
 Improved SCCS / RCS: Let your source control system keep track not
  only of past versions of your source code, but also of future versions.
  Saves a lot of work.

#Real Programmers don't write applications programs. They program
right down to the bare metal. Applications programs are for dullards
who can't do systems programming.
#Real Programmers don't write specs. Users should be grateful
for whatever they get. They are lucky to get any program at all.
#Real Programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write,
it should be hard to understand and even harder to modify.
#Real Programmers don't draw flowcharts. Flowcharts are, after all,
the illiterate's form of documentation. Cavemen drew flowcharts;
look how much it  did for them.
#Real Programmers don't document. Documentation is for simps
who can't read the listings or the object deck.
#Real Programmers don't read manuals. Reliance on a reference
is a hallmark  of  the novice and the coward.
#Real Programmers don't use COBOL.
COBOL is for wimpy applications programmers.
#Real Programmers don't use Fortran. Fortran is for wimpy
engineers who wear white socks pipe stress freaks, and
crystallography weenies. They get excited over finite state
analysis and nuclear reactor simulation.
#Real Programmers don't use PL/I. PL/I is for insecure momma's boys
who can't choose between Cobol and Fortran.
#Real Programmers don't use LOGO. In fact, *no* programmers
use LOGO after reaching puberty.
#Real Programmers don't use APL, unless the whole program
can be written on one line.
#Real Programmers don't use LISP. Only effemitate programmers
use more parentheses than actual code.
#Real Programmers don't use Pascal, Bliss, ADA or any of those
sissy-pinko computer science languages. Strong typing is a
crutch for people with weak memories.
#Real Programmers never work 9 to 5. If any real programmers are
around at 9 a.m. it's because they were up all night.
#Real Programmers don't play tennis or any other sport which requires
a change of clothes. Mountain climbing is ok, and real programmers
often  wear climbing boots to work in case a mountain should suddenly
spring up in the middle of the machine room.
#Real Programmers disdain structured programming. Structured programming
is for compulsive, prematurely toilet-trained neurotics who wear neckties
and carefully line up sharpened pencils on an otherwise uncluttered desk.
#Real Programmers don't like the team programming concept.
Unless, of course, they are the Chief Programmer.
#Real Programmers have no use for managers. Managers are a necessary
evil. Managers are for dealing with personnel bozos, bean counters,
senior planners and other mental defectives.
#Real Programmers scorn floating point arithmetic. The decimal point
was invented for pansy bedwetters who are unable to "think big."
#Real Programmers don't drive clapped-out Mavericks. They prefer
BMWs, Lincolns or pick-up trucks with floor shifts. Fast motorcycles
are highly regarded.
#Real Programmers don't believe in schedules. Planners make up
schedules. Managers "firm up" schedules. Frightened coders strive
to meet schedules. Real programmers ignore schedules.
#Real Programmers like vending machine popcorn. Coders pop it in
the microwave oven. Real programmers use the heat given off by
the CPU. They can tell what job is running just by listening to
the rate of popping.
#Real Programmers know every nuance of every instruction and use them
all in every real program. Puppy architects won't allow execute
instructions to address another execute as the target instruction.
Real programmers despise such petty restrictions.
#Real Programmers don't bring brown bag lunches to work.
If the vending machine sells it, they eat it. If the
vending machine doesn't sell it, they  don't eat it.
Vending machines don't sell quiche.
#Real Programmers think better when playing Adventure or Rogue.
#Real Programs don't use shared text. Otherwise, how can they use
functions for scratch space after they are finished calling them?
#Real Programmers' programs never work right the first time. But if
you throw them on the machine they can be patched into working in
"only a few" 30-hour debugging sessions.
#Real Programmers don't write in BASIC.  Actually, no programmers
write in BASIC, after the age of 12.

#        A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling
                          by Mark Twain

   For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped
to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer
be part of the alphabet.  The only kase in which "c" would be retained
would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later.  Year 2
might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the
same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with

#A priest asked: What is Fate, Master?

And He answered:

It is that which gives a beast of burden its reason for existence.

It is that which men in former times had to bear upon their backs.

It is that which has caused nations to build byways from City to City
upon which carts and coaches pass, and alongside which inns have come
to be built to stave off Hunger, Thirst and Weariness.

And that is Fate?  said the priest.

Fate... I thought you said Freight, responded the Master.

That's all right, said the priest.  I wanted to know what Freight was
too.

As a method of sending a missile to the higher, and even to the highest
parts of the earth's atmospheric envelope, Professor Goddard's rocket
is a practicable and therefore promising device. It is when one
considers the multiple-charge rocket as a traveler to the moon that one
begins to doubt ... for after the rocket quits our air and really
starts on its journey, its flight would be neither accelerated nor
maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left.
Professor Goddard, with his "chair" in Clark College and countenancing
of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to
re-action, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum
against which to react ... Of course he only seems to lack the
knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.

many important electrical experiments.  For example, in 1780 Luigi
Galvani discovered (this is the truth) that when he attached two
different kinds of metal to the leg of a frog, an electrical current
developed and the frog's leg kicked, even though it was no longer
attached to the frog, which was dead anyway. Galvani's discovery led
to enormous advances in the field of amphibian medicine.  Today,
skilled veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has been seriously
injured or killed, implant pieces of metal in its muscles, and watch it
hop back into the pond just like a normal frog, except for the fact

Forty-two - and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to

whatever battles it was that the slower-than-light fleets had been sent
to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier by the time
they actually got there.
   This didn't, of course, deter their crews from wanting to fight the
battles anyway. They were trained, they were ready, they'd had a couple
of thousand years' sleep, they'd come a long way to do a tough job and
by Zarquon they were going to do it.
   This was when the first major muddles of Galactic history set in,
with battles continually re-erupting centruries after the issues they
had been fought over had supposedly been settled. However, these muddles
were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and unravel once
time-travel was discovered and battles started pre-erupting hundreds of
years before the issues even arose. When the Infinite Improbability
Drive arrived and whole planets started turning unexpectedly into banana
fruitcake, the great history faculty of the University of MaxiMegalon
finally gave up, closed itself down and surrendered its buildings to the
rapidly growing joint faculty of Divinity and Water Polo, which had been
after them for years.

easily be proved that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed

without a flaw; it is still unimpeachable. The judges' decisions based
on it were sound in logic and in law. Nothing in any existing court
was ever more thoroughly proved than the charges of witchcraft and

#But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison, who
was a brilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal
education and lived in New Jersey. Edison's first major invention in
1877, was the phonograph, which could soon be found in thousands of
American homes, where it basically sat until 1923, when the record was
invented. But Edison's greatest achievement came in 1879, when he
invented the electric company. Edison's design was a brilliant
adaptation of the simple electrical circuit: the electric company sends
electricity through a wire to a customer, then immediately gets the
electricity back through another wire, then (this is the brilliant
part) sends it right back to the customer again.

This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch
of electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since
very few customers take the time to examine their electricity closely.
In fact the last year any new electricity was generated in the United
States was 1937; the electric companies have been merely re-selling it
ever since, which is why they have so much free time to apply for rate
increases.

#                DETERIORATA

Go placidly amid the noise and waste,
And remember what comfort there may be in owning a piece thereof.
Avoid quiet and passive persons, unless you are in need of sleep.
Rotate your tires.
Speak glowingly of those greater than yourself,
And heed well their advice -- even though they be turkeys.
Know what to kiss -- and when.
Remember that two wrongs never make a right,
But that three do.
Wherever possible, put people on "HOLD".
Be comforted, that in the face of all aridity and disillusionment,
And despite the changing fortunes of time,
There is always a big future in computer maintenance.

      You are a fluke of the universe ...

#                   -- Gifts for Children --

This is easy. You never have to figure out what to get for children,
because they will tell you exactly what they want. They spend months
and months researching these kinds of things by watching Saturday-
morning cartoon-show advertisements. Make sure you get your children
exactly what they ask for, even if you disapprove of their choices. If
your child thinks he wants Murderous Bob, the Doll with the Face You
Can Rip Right Off, you'd better get it. You may be worried that it
might help to encourage your child's antisocial tendencies, but believe
me, you have not seen antisocial tendencies until you've seen a child
who is convinced that he or she did not get the right gift.

#                     -- Gifts for Men --

Men are amused by almost any idiot thing - that is why professional
ice hockey is so popular - so buying gifts for them is easy. But you
should never buy them clothes. Men believe they already have all the
clothes they will ever need, and new ones make them nervous. For
example, your average man has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only
three of them. He has learned, through humiliating trial and error,
that if he wears any of the other 81 ties, his wife will probably laugh
at him ("You're not going to wear THAT tie with that suit, are you?").
So he has narrowed it down to three safe ties, and has gone several
years without being laughed at. If you give him a new tie, he will
pretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.

If you want to give a man something practical, consider tires. More
than once, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got for a new set
of tires.

#Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical
lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach
your hand into a friend's mouth and touch one of his dental fillings.
Did you notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in
pain? This teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force,
but we must never use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an
important electrical lesson.

It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works. When you scuffed
your feet, you picked up batches of "electrons", which are very small
objects that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will
attract dirt. The electrons travel through your bloodstream and
collect in your finger, where they form a spark that leaps to your
friend's filling, then travels down to his feet and back into the
carpet, thus completing the circuit.

Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without
touching anything, you would build up so many electrons that your
finger would explode!  But this is nothing to worry about unless you
have carpeting.

#                     JACK AND THE BEANSTACK
                          by Mark Isaak

   Long ago, in a finite state far away, there lived a JOVIAL character
named Jack. Jack and his relations were poor. Often their hash table was
bare. One day Jack's parent said to him, "Our matrices are sparse. You
must go to the market to exchange our RAM for some BASICs." She compiled
a linked list of items to retrieve and passed it to him.
   So Jack set out. But as he was walking along a Hamilton path, he met
the traveling salesman.
   "Whither dost thy flow chart take thou?" prompted the salesman in
high-level language.
   "I'm going to the market to exchange this RAM for some chips and
Apples," commented Jack.
   "I have a much better algorithm. You needn't join a queue there; I
will swap your RAM for these magic kernels now."
   Jack made the trade, then backtracked to his house. But when he told
his busy-waiting parent of the deal, she became so angry she started
thrashing.
   "Don't you even have any artificial intelligence? All these kernels
together hardly make up one byte," and she popped them out the window...

can put in for an enormous refund and the agent will probably give it

a dream of a machine, with springs and gears and perfect in every
respect. And they lived with it, and on it, and under it, and inside
it, for it was all they had - first they saved up all their atoms,
then they put them all together, and if one didn't fit, why they
chipped at it a bit, and everything was just fine...

#Once upon a time, when I was training to be a mathematician, a group
of us bright young students taking number theory discovered the names
of the smaller prime numbers.

2:  The Odd Prime -
        It's the only even prime, therefore is odd.  QED.
3:  The True Prime -
        Lewis Carroll: "If I tell you 3 times, it's true."
31: The Arbitrary Prime -
        Determined by unanimous unvote. We needed an arbitrary prime
        in case the prof asked for one, and so had an election. 91
        received the most votes (well, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i the
        next most. However, 31 was the only candidate to receive none
        at all.

Since the composite numbers are formed from primes, their qualities are
derived from those primes. So, for instance, the number 6 is "odd but
true", while the powers of 2 are all extremely odd numbers.
#   Once there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a
great crystal river.  Each creature in its own manner clung tightly to
the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging was their way of
life, and resisting the current what each had learned from birth.  But
one creature said at last, "I trust that the current knows where it is
going.  I shall let go, and let it take me where it will.  Clinging, I
shall die of boredom."
   The other creatures laughed and said, "Fool!  Let go, and that
current you worship will throw you tumbled and smashed across the
rocks, and you will die quicker than boredom!"
   But the one heeded them not, and taking a breath did let go,
and at once was tumbled and smashed by the current across the rocks.
Yet, in time, as the creature refused to cling again, the current
lifted him free from the bottom, and he was bruised and hurt no more.
   And the creatures downstream, to whom he was a stranger, cried,
"See a miracle!  A creature like ourselves, yet he flies!  See the
Messiah, come to save us all!"  And the one carried in the current
said, "I am no more Messiah than you.  The river delight to lift us
free, if only we dare let go.  Our true work is this voyage, this
adventure.
   But they cried the more, "Saviour!" all the while clinging to
the rocks, making legends of a Saviour.

#   One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How enthusiastic
is our support for UNIX?
   Unix was written on our machines and for our machines many years ago.
Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of
our VAXs are going for UNIX use. UNIX is a simple language, easy to
understand, easy to get started with. It's great for students, great for
somewhat casual users, and it's great for interchanging programs between
different machines. And so, because of its popularity in these markets,
we support it. We have good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
   It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run out
of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will end up
doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.
   With UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quickly
check that small manual and find out that it's not there. With VMS,
no matter what you look for - it's literally a five-foot shelf of
documentation - if you look long enough it's there. That's the difference
- the beauty of UNIX is it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all
there.

7:  The car directly in front of you has a flashing right tail

       (a) one of the tail lights is broken; you should blow your horn
           to call the problem to the driver's attention.
       (b) the driver is signaling a right turn.
       (c) the driver is signaling a left turn.
       (d) the driver is from out of town.

The correct answer is (d). Tail lights are used in some foreign
countries to signal turns.

The correct answer is (a). Pedestrians are not in cars, so they are
totally irrelevant to driving; you should ignore them completely.

#Proof techniques 1: Proof by Induction.

This technique is used on equations with "N" in them. Induction
techniques are very popular, even the military used them.

SAMPLE: Proof of induction without proof of induction.

   We know it's true for N equal to 1. Now assume that it's true
for every natural number less than N. N is arbitrary, so we can take N
as large as we want. If N is sufficiently large, the case of N+1 is
trivially equivalent, so the only important N are N less than N. We
can take N = N (from above), so it's true for N+1 because it's just
about N.
   QED.    (QED translates from the Latin as "So what?")
#Proof techniques 2: Proof by oddity.
SAMPLE: To prove that horses have an infinite number of legs.

   (1) Horses have an even number of legs.
   (2) They have two legs in back and fore legs in front.
   (3) This makes a total of six legs, which certainly is an odd number
       of legs for a horse.
   (4) But the only number that is both odd and even is infinity.
   (5) Therefore, horses must have an infinite number of legs.

Topics to be covered in future issues include proof by:
       Intimidation
       Gesticulation (handwaving)
       "Try it; it works"
       Constipation (I was just sitting there and ...)
       Blatant assertion
       Changing all the 2's to N's
       Mutual consent
       Lack of a counterexample, and
       "It stands to reason"
#Proof techniques 3: Proof by intimidation.

SAMPLE: Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs.

Horses have an even number of legs. Behind they have two legs, and in
front they have fore-legs. This makes six legs, which is certainly an
odd number of legs for a horse. But the only number that is both even
and odd is infinity. Therefore, horses have an infinite number of
legs. Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,
there is a horse that has a finite number of legs. But that is a horse
of another color, and by the [above] lemma ["All horses are the same
color"], that does not exist.

#           Safety Tips for the Post-Nuclear Existence
1.  Never use an elevator in a building that has been hit by a nuclear
    bomb; use the stairs.
2.  When you're flying through the air, remember to roll when you hit
    the ground.
3.  If you're on fire, avoid gasoline and other flammable materials.
4.  Don't attempt communication with dead people; it will only lead to
    psychological problems.
5.  Food will be scarce; you will have to scavenge. Learn to recognize
    foods that will be available after the bomb: mashed potatoes,
    shredded wheat, tossed salad, ground beef, etc.
6.  Put your hand over your mouth when you sneeze; internal organs will
    be scarce in the post-nuclear age.
7.  Try to be neat; fall only in designated piles.
8.  Drive carefully in "Heavy Fallout" areas; people could be
    staggering illegally.
9.  Nutritionally, hundred dollar bills are equal to ones, but more
    sanitary due to limited circulation.
10. Accumulate mannequins now; spare parts will be in short supply on
    D-Day.

#Sixtus V, Pope from 1585 to 1590 authorized a printing of the Vulgate
Bible. Taking no chances, the pope issued a papal bull automatically
excommunicating any printer who might make an alteration in the text.
This he ordered printed at the beginning of the Bible. He personally
examined every sheet as it came off the press. Yet the published
Vulgate Bible contained so many errors that corrected scraps had to be
printed and pasted over them in every copy. The result provoked wry
comments on the rather patchy papal infallibility, and Pope Sixtus had
no recourse but to order the return and destruction of every copy.

because it is absurd). This does not altogether accord with historical

     it is absurd. And buried he rose again, which is certain
     because it is impossible."

#The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our
authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as
the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as
the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much
radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much
as the Earth does from the Sun, or 50 times in all. The light we receive
from the Moon is one 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the Sun, so
we can ignore that... The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to
the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat
received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses 50 times as much heat as the
Earth by radiation.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation,
(H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute temperature of the earth (-300K),
gives H as 798K (525C). The exact temperature of Hell cannot be
computed... [However] Revelations 21:8 says "But the fearful, and
unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire
and brimstone."  A lake of molten brimstone means that its temperature
must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C.  We have, then, that
Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.

The programmers were wrung out too mindless to care,

#Wood is highly ecological, since trees are a renewable resource.  If
you cut down a tree, another will grow in its place.  And if you cut
down the new tree, still another will grow.  And if you cut down that
tree, yet another will grow, only this one will be a mutation with
long, poisonous tentacles and revenge in its heart, and it will sit
there in the forest, cackling and making elaborate plans for when you
come back.

Wood heat is not new.  It dates back to a day millions of years ago,
when a group of cavemen were sitting around, watching dinosaurs rot.
Suddenly, lightning struck a nearby log and set it on fire.  One of the
cavemen stared at the fire for a few minutes, then said: "Hey!  Wood
heat!"  The other cavemen, who did not understand English, immediately
beat him to death with stones.  But the key discovery had been made,
and from that day forward, the cavemen had all the heat they needed,
although their insurance rates went way up.

                THE CHURCH OF COUNTERFACTUAL BELIEF

The Church of Counterfactual Belief has been set up to cater to all who
do not allow demonstrable truth to get in the way of their beliefs.  In
addition to creation science and the flatness of the earth, the
following beliefs have been certified by Pope Duane as Church dogma:

    -  That there is a hole in the Earth at the North Pole from which
       UFOs come.
    -  That pi equals precisely 3.000.
    -  That sex can be enjoyed only by blacks and homosexuals.
    -  That Billy Joe Wilson (Hoopla, Miss.) has successfully squared
       the circle.
    -  That Harry Truman is still president, and doing a fine job.
    -  That pi equals precisely 22/7.

Several other important counterfactual beliefs are presently being
studied, including Reaganomics, A.I., and that the moon landings were
done in a Hollywood special effects studio.  These will be the subject
of a forthcoming Papal Bull...

#Once upon a time, there was a non-conforming sparrow who decided not to
fly south for the winter.  However, soon after the weather turned cold,
the sparrow changed his mind and reluctantly started to fly south.
After a short time, ice began to form on his wings and he fell to earth
in a barnyard almost frozen.  A cow passed by and crapped on this little
bird and the sparrow thought it was the end, but the manure warmed him
and defrosted his wings.  Warm and happy the little sparrow began to
sing.  Just then, a large Tom cat came by and hearing the chirping
investigated the sounds.  As Old Tom cleared away the manure, he found
the chirping bird and promptly ate him.

There are three morals to this story:

   1. Everyone who shits on you is not necessarily your enemy.
   2. Everyone who gets you out of shit is not necessarily your friend.
   3. If you are warm and happy in a pile of shit, keep your mouth shut.
#One day President Reagan, Chairman Andropov, the Pope, and a boy scout
were flying together in an airplane.  Right out in the middle of
nowhere the plane developed engine trouble and started to go down.
Unfortunately, only three parachutes could be found for the four
passengers!  Andropov grabbed one of the parachutes and declared
"Comrades, as leader of the socialist workers revolution, my life must
be spared," and he jumped out of the plane.  Then Reagan exclaimed "As
leader of the greatest nation on earth, I must keep the world safe for
democracy," and with that he too jumped to safety.  Now if you are
following all this (or counting on your fingers) you must see that
there is only one parachute left for the two remaining passengers.  The
Pope looked kindly upon the boy scout and said "I have had a long and
productive life, my son.  You take the parachute and leave me in God's
hands."  "That's very kind of you," the observant scout replied, "but
there is no need.  Reagan just jumped out with my knapsack."

grow out of it.  We just grow horny.  That's the problem.  We mix up

#A cat and a rooster were stranded on an island with hardly any food.
Soon, they ran out of food. However, they realised that there is
another island not very far away with plenty of food. After some
discussions, they decided to try to jump over to the other island.
The cat went first, but didn't make it and fell into the water. The
rooster took a jump and a few flaps and there he was on the other
island. The rooster was satisfied, and it looked back with sympathy
at the poor cat who was all wet and drawning.
What is the moral of this story ?

Behind every satisfied cock, there is a wet pussy ...

"OK," the man says, "You take the front and I'll take the back."

#She asked me if I loved her still. "Yes," I replied.
"I've never had you any other way."
#... So this is a very confusing situation, and what makes it even worse
is, our standards keep changing. Take Playboy magazine. Back in the 1950s,
when I started reading it strictly for the articles, Playboy was
considered just about the raciest thing around, even though all it ever
showed was women's breasts. Granted, any given one of these breasts would
have provided adequate shelter for a family of four, but the overall
effect was no more explicit than many publications we think nothing of
today, such as Sports Illustrated's Annual Nipples Poking Through
Swimsuits Issue.

#Sure eating yogurt will improve your sex life. People know that if
you'll eat that stuff, you'll eat anything.
#   The big problem with pornography is defining it. You can't just
say it's pictures of people naked. For example, you have these
primitive African tribes that exist by chasing the wildebeest on foot,
and they have to go around largely naked, because, as the old tribal
saying goes: "N'wam k'honi soit qui mali," which means, "If you think
you can catch a wildebeest in this climate and wear clothes at the same
time, then I have some beach front property in the desert region of
Northern Mali that you may be interested in."
    So it's not considered pornographic when National Geographic
publishes color photographs of these people hunting the wildebeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto another rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever. But if National Geographic were to publish an
article entitled "The Girls of the California Junior College System
Hunt the Wildebeest Naked," some people would call it pornography. But
others would not. And still others, such as the Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwell, would get upset about seeing the wildebeest naked.

#They [District Attorneys] learn in District Attorney School that there
are two sure-fire ways to get a lot of favorable publicity:

  1. Go down and raid all the lockers in the local high school and
     confiscate 53 marijuana cigarettes and put them in a pile and hold
     a press conference where you announce that they have a street value
     of $850 million. These raids never fail, because ALL high schools,
     including brand-new, never-used ones, have at least 53 marijuana
     cigarettes in the lockers. As far as anyone can tell, the locker
     factory puts them there.
  2. Raid an "adult book store" and hold a press conference where you
     announce you are charging the owner with 850 counts of being a
     piece of human sleaze. This also never fails, because you always
     get a conviction. A juror at a pornography trial is not about to
     state for the record that he finds nothing obscene about a movie
     where actors engage in sexual activities with live snakes and a
     fire extinguisher. He is going to convict the bookstore owner, and
     vote for the death penalty just to make sure nobody gets the wrong

bellows out: "WHO IS THE GREATEST AND STRONGEST OF ALL THE JUNGLE
ANIMALS?"  The deer is shaking so hard it can barely speak, but manages
to stammer: "Oh great tiger, you are by far the mightiest animal in the
jungle."  The tiger, being on a roll, swaggered, up to an elephant that
was quietly munching on some weeds, and roared at the top of his voice:
"WHO IS THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL THE ANIMALS IN THE JUNGLE?"  Well, this
elephant grabs the tiger with his trunk, picks him up, slams him down;
picks him up again, and shakes him until the tiger is just a blur of
orange and black; and finally throws him violently into a nearby tree.

Indeed, men are of the opinion that without bodily pleasures, life is
not worth living.  But bodily pleasures are slavish, and the true
philosopher abstains from them.
   There appears to be a need for some bold men who will say outright
what is best, oppose the mightiest lust, and follow reason only.
   The greatest cause of crimes is lust.  The fire of sexual lust
kindles every species of wantonness.
   Due to defective knowledge, men err in their choice of pleasures.
   Our body fills us with desires and passions and vain imaginings
and a host of frivolities.  But once having got rid of the foolishness
of the body, we shall be pure, and know the clear light of truth.

"Be sober and chaste. Sex is always harmful and not conducive to health."
"When can I engage in sex?" one of his students asked.
"Whenever you want to be weaker than yourself," Pythagoras replied.

#No attained object of desire can give lasting satisfaction;
it can produce merely a fleeting gratification. Desires last
long; the demands are infinite; the satisfaction is short.
The satisfied passion leads more often to unhappiness than
to happiness.  As long as we are given up to a throng of
desires, we can never have lasting happiness or peace.

sceptical of the adverts' messages. Their interpretations were
often quite sophisticated. A spot for Listerine mouthwash was
seen as a morality play where evil (bad breath) was conquered

   self-documenting structured programming through constructs such as

        (*wnd->func)(*++addr)

   which means call the routine whose address is stored in the "func"
   part of the structure pointed to by "wnd", and pass to it the
   contents of the cell pointed to by the pointer in "addr" after it
   (the pointer, not the contents) has been incremented.  Or something

#Hacker:
   A programmer who grew up tapping out Morse Code on a ham radio,
   and has never forgiven IBM for not putting a front switch panel
   on the original PC.  Recognizable by the oversize ring of keys
   on the belt that pulls his/her pants down just past the shirt
   tail (which, naturally, must hang out since there is nothing to
   be tucked into), and the list of phone numbers and passwords in

#Local Area Network (LAN):
   High-tech cousin of the mainframe nominally designed to allow people
   to share information and snoop into personal letters and resumes
   queued for the laser printer.  True rationale is to (a) sell hardware,
   and (b) build data processing (DP) empires.  When a DP operation runs
   smoothly, it gets no attention from money-laden-management.  LAN's
   purchased by "technology visionaries" to "increase power and future
   capacity" guarantee anomalous problems for years to come.
   Tech-terrified managers are told that bonuses "to keep our valuable
   people" and more hardware budget are the only solutions to the
   problems. Blackmail buys electronic mail.
@from the Computer Experts Glossary
#Micro Channel Architecture (MCA):
   IBM's new bus that caries information in 32-bit packets.
   The first bus developed solely by lawyers, it is considered
   copy-proof (the theory being that no one would want anything
   created by lawyers).  The bus is actually 48 bits wide, but
   the lawyers take 1/3 of anything they work on.  A not-so-subtle
   attempt to limit the market to IBM.

#Microsoft:
   Contract programming house for IBM, and primary sustainer of
   the clone market.  IBM pays MS to write fancy software, then
   MS tweaks it a little, slaps the MS logon on it, and sells it
   to all the clone folks so they can keep competing with IBM.
   There is no truth to the rumor that former Mafioso procure the
   IBM contracts for MS.  All products are given generic names
   (Word, Project, Works, Windows, etc.) to (a) confuse everybody
   unless (b) the name "Microsoft" is constantly repeated.  Made
   the founder $300,000,000+ in one day.

#Novice:

   his/her time trying to get into the joke and adult message
   bulletin boards.
@from the Computer Experts Glossary
#OS/2:
   Originally intended as a Killer App to make everybody swoon over
   the MCA (hence, killing the good ol' AT bus), but it runs just
   fine without MCA.  Now OS/2 needs its own Killer App to kill off
   DOS and Unix.  Alas, every candidate application runs better
   without OS/2 ("of course it runs slower - it does sooo much
   more")... Sporadically achieves DOS compatibility through the use
   of the aptly-named "Chernobyl Box".

#Pascal:
   Language named after a dead mathematician who dreamed up
   the first computer.  That computer, like the language,
   was non-programmable. But it was a good idea.

#Ph.D.:
   A user with more sense than money.  Ph.D's generally have elegant
   solutions to problems that don't exist.  The (top-down, of course)
   solutions always work because they have never been programmed.
   (Stands for piled high and deep, as in
   B.S., M.S., Ph.D. = bull s..t, more s..t, etc. ed.)

#Power user:
   A user with more money than sense.  A power user buys all the latest
   and greatest hardware, spends long hours running short timing tests,
   and grants 30+ interviews per week to columnists.  Proud to know
   every variation of the DOS dir command.  As a kid, the power user
   was first in line to see "Star Wars" (all 22 times s/he saw it),
   and acted as assistant equipment manager for the football team.

#Presentation Manager:
   IBM's Next-influenced Windows-derived display and user interface
   program. It is almost compatible with Windows, thus, causing PMS
   (Presentation Manager Schizophrenia) among developers who don't
   know where to target their work. They usually settle for something
   other than PM which could kill it (if its OS/2-heritage doesn't
   do it first).
@from the Computer Experts Glossary
#RISC:
   Runtime Increases on Speed Computers: yep, the computer is faster
   but the application is slower. This marvel of optimization (invented
   by electrical engineers) reduces the number and complexity of
   processor instructions. These simple-and-few instructions execute
   fast, which makes for impressive statistics in the processor
   brochure. Of course, programs require many more of the simple
   instructions to accomplish their tasks which often results in slower
   overall execution.
@from the Computer Experts Glossary
#Structured design:
   Program development technique which stresses the stepwise
   decomposition of problems in an egoless environment. Often
   results in the spontaneous decomposition of egos. Reportedly
   used in several big projects, none of which have been
   completed yet. See top-down.
@from the Computer Experts Glossary
#Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR):
   Modeled after the tenure system in schools (where teachers retire
   on the job, and can't be excised), this type of program runs and
   terminates, but does not give up its memory space.  Many TSRs can
   be (re)awakened - at any time, even if you are running another
   application - by hitting a special key combination (the so-called
   "hot key") which is inevitably the same key combination used by
   the application you are running to delete all files.
@from the Computer Experts Glossary
#Top-down:
   Program design methodology which is equivalent to solving a maze
   by starting at the treasure chest in the middle (the program goal)
   and tracing backwards to see how to get there.  Works flawlessly
   if you do indeed start at the program goal.  A decidedly dull
   approach to programming.  Thank goodness, not one single program
   goal has ever been fully know before the program was completed,
   so one must eventually resort to bottom-up programming.  The "goto"
   programming construct is not allowed and the whole program is split
   into subroutines of not more than 25 lines of code (most of which
   are subroutine calls).  See bottom-up.
@from the Computer Experts Glossary
#Unix:
   Conceptual granddaddy of DOS and OS/2, this operating system is
   condemned as too cryptic (with commands like cd and mkdir) for
   PC users, but great for others.  Unix is also hampered by
   ready-availability on diverse hardware (wouldn't it be confusing
   if your VAX and PC operated with the same commands?), a notable
   lack of bugs, and new versions with DOS compatibility. IBM and
   Microsoft fully understand the power of Unix, and despite the fact
   that they would not profit by its adaptation (AT&T would), they
   try as hard as they can to get people to use it.  Alas, they
   report users just keep clamoring for OS/2 (which IBM and MS
   coincidentally make a lot of money on).

      LOGO is for children
      APL is for martians.
      FORTH, LISP and PROLOG are specialty languages.

#The documentary-makers know darned good and well that the viewers
aren't going to remain glued to their seats to watch divers paddling
around in waters infested by, for example, clams, so they stick with
sharks.  Generally, their procedure is to scatter bleeding fish
pieces around their boat, so as to infest the waters.  I would
estimate that the primary food source of sharks today is bleeding
fish pieces scattered by people making documentaries.  Once the
sharks arrive, they are generally fairly listless. The general shark
attitude seems to be: `Oh, God, another documentary.'  So the divers
have to somehow goad them into attacking, under the guise of
Scientific Research.  `We know very little about the effect of
electricity on sharks,' the narrator will say, in a deeply scientific
voice.  `That is why Todd is going to jab this Great White in the
testicles with a cattle prod.'  The divers keep this kind of thing up
until the shark finally gets irritated and snaps at them, and then
they act as though this was a totally unexpected and very dangerous
development, although clearly it is what they wanted all along.

"Put yourself in the worm's place.  So far your life has been one of
continuous crawling, eating dirt, and being covered with slime. You're not
much to look at, even if you had a way of seeing yourself. The only thing
you look forward to is sex, and that's with other worms.  Then, on top of
it all, it rains.  So the worms you see are not crossing the road. They're
waiting.  For your car."

"As a child, you knew instinctively, stomping a worm on the sidewalk is
exactly what it wants. The next time it rains, get in your car and drive
as much as possible.  You'll be doing a lot of worms a favor, pushing
them into the next stage of reincarnation, so they can be reborn as a
Yorkshire Terrier, or a lawyer."

  2. Though shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; but he

     and likewise he who sweareth falsely by it in matters of National
     Security.
  3. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it wholly miserable for thyself

  4. Honor thy father and thy mother; but Medicare is going too far.
  5. Thou shalt not kill the innocent babe in the womb.  After it's
     born... open season.
  6. Thou shalt not commit adultery, women especially.
  7. Thou shalt steal.
  8. Thou shalt declare for business against big labor.
  9. Thou shalt not call up thy neighbor's wife.
 10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house; but thou shalt work thy

                MICROSOFT UNVEILS MS-DOS VERSION 55.0

The latest operating system  from Microsoft should  do a lot to  alleviate
the frustrations of PC owners.  Aging Microsoft president Bill Gates says:
"I think we got it right this time."  The system includes  user interfaces
for handwriting, voice, hand signals, eye movement, winking,  blinking and
even, if you buy the optional cables and skull probes,  a direct brainwave
command system.  Responding to  user demand,  Microsoft has recapitulated,
and included WordStar-like control key commands in the  full-screen editor
for those few people  who refuse  to abandon  their keyboards.  For people
who  are intimidated  by control keys they still  include the old  standby
line editor, Edlin.  Unfortunately, this latest version of MS-DOS does not
yet overcome the 640 kilobyte memory restriction.

                  APPLE SUES 200 COMPUTER COMPANIES

   Apple Computer Corp.  claims that  all companies who still use keyboards
on their computers are infringing  on Apple's intellectual property rights.
Apple's president,  general manager,  chief executive officer,  chairman of
the board  and company king  for life,  John Sculley,  said:  "We pioneered
the idea of using  a keyboard  with a computer;  we must be able, some way,
to recover  the enormous  research  cost  that was involved."  When  it was
pointed out  to him that  other companies used keyboards on their computers
before Apple, he said:  "Let them sue us."
   In  related news,  Apple has just laid off  97 percent of its  remaining
staff.  As  the  corporation consists  by now almost entirely of  automated
factories,  digital distribution networks and robot design bureaus, Sculley
said it  was  time  to "streamline"  the company.  The numbers  are a well-
guarded secret, but most industry analysts predict that the remaining staff
will consist of three employees - Sculley, his secretary and his dog.  When
asked how Apple expected  robot designers to complete  development of their
latest  computer,  the  Macintosh XvZdCIXVlsd+,  Sculley  said:  "Actually,
computers do a much better job of designing computers than do human beings.
I wish  we had had them  in the beginning, when we designed  the Apple I in
that garage.  It would have saved us all sorts of personnel problems."

                  STEVE JOBS FOUNDS NEW COMPANY

Many computer companies get nervous when Steve Jobs, computer wizard and
industry darling,  starts up a new company  to make a  brand-new machine
(this will be the  18th time he has done this).  They might get particu-
larly nervous  this time,  because Jobs is, as he put it, "taking a page
out of history"  and building a computer based on old,  well-established
principles.  Called, simply, The fIRsT, the new computer will include an
antique keyboard  with the control and enter keys  in the right place, a
powerful command-line interface similar to an ancient system called CP/M
and no mice, touch screens, microphones, 3D-glasses or digital gloves.

The 801586SX is a hybrid 116 and 128-bit chip that Intel hopes will finally
wean people off their old computers, based on the 80286.  Intel claims that
people will buy this chip, because it will allow them to run the new brain-
wave  interface.  But  some  industry  analysts  are not  so sure.  At  the
Timbuctoo Comdex Computer Show  last month,  one said:  "Why  should people
buy a computer based on a chip that costs $432,000, when they can get a 286
computer for $24.95?"

#"Satire is inherently unfair, and although it may be unfair to any
form of authority, or any form of hypocrisy, there is no such-thing
as an even-handed joke.  Satirizing a military cretin or corporate
banditry doesn't make you a liberal any more than satirizing some
self-important wishy-washy makes you a neofascist.  Of course, it is
perfectly possible for an ideology to get laughs at the expense of an
opponent -- but this is ridicule, a potent weapon of humor, and not
satire.  A satirist who espouses one ideology over another is saying
in effect that he is superior -- and that makes him satirizable.  The
satirist believes only that there is no such thing as being half-
pregnant or half-nuked.  From the standpoint of authority, satire is
the most inimical form of free speech there is."

       reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit
       directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-
       perfect hole.  The threat of skunks or matrimony often
       catalyzes this reaction.
#Cartoon Law IV:
   The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater
   than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the
   ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.
       Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture
       it inevitably unsuccessful.
#Cartoon Law V:
   All principles of gravity are negated by fear.
       Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to
       propel them directly away from the earth's surface.  A spooky
       noise or an adversary's signature sound will induce motion
       upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or
       the crest of a flagpole.  The feet of a character who is
       running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch
       the ground, especially when in flight.
#Cartoon Law VI:
   As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.
       This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in
       which a character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the
       cloud of altercation at several places simultaneously.  This
       effect is common as well among bodies that are spinning or
       being throttled.  A 'wacky' character has the option of self-
       replication only at manic high speeds and may ricochet off
       walls to achieve the velocity required.
#Cartoon Law VII:
   Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble
   tunnel entrances; others cannot.
       This trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generations, but
       at least it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a
       wall's surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue
       him into this theoretical space.  The painter is flattened
       against the wall when he attempts to follow into the painting.
       This is ultimately a problem of art, not of science.
#Cartoon Law VIII:
   Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.
       Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional
       nine lives might comfortably afford.  They can be decimated,
       spliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled,
       but they cannot be destroyed.  After a few moments of blinking
       self pity, they reinflate, elongate, snap back, or solidify.

   Corollary: A cat will assume the shape of its container.
#Cartoon Law IX:
   For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance.
       This is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also
       applies to the physical world at large.  For that reason,
       we need the relief of watching it happen to a duck instead.
#The conductor was getting more and more fed-up with the orchestra.
In particular, one female cellist was losing every way.  Finally,
the conductor said to her:  "Madam, you have between your legs an
instrument that could give pleasure to thousands, and all you can
seem to do is scratch it."
#            "The Stress Diet" Diet Tips

1.  If no one sees you eat it, it has no calories.
2.  If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, they cancel each
    other out.
3.  Foods used for medicinal purposes NEVER count, such as:
    chocolate, a Brandy toast, or a Sara Lee cheescake.
4.  If you fatten-up everyone around you, then you look thinner.
5.  Movie-related foods (such as Milk Duds, popcorn with butter,
    Junior Mints, and Red Fine's licorice) do not count because
    they are simply part of the entertainment experience and not
    part of ones personal fuel.
6.  When eating with someone else, calories do not count if you
    both eat the same amount.
7.  Cookie pieces contain no calories.  The process of breakage
    causes calorie leakage.
8.  If you eat something (particualrly pie, sausage, gravy and
    ice cream) from another persons plate (particularly if they
    are your children or other family members), there is no
    calorie gain to you.  All calories are ascribed to plate
    owners.

#There once was a minister who found himself growing away from his
congregation. In an attempt to come closer once again, he decided to
visit many of his fellow parishioners.  At the home of an elderly
widow he was invited in but was asked to wait a few minutes while she
finished preparing her evening meal.  As he sat and waited he began
eating from a bowl of peanuts that was sitting on the edge of the
table.  Before he knew it, he  had eaten the whole bowl of peanuts.
When the woman returned to the living room, the minister said quite
apologetically, with much embarrassment that he had eaten all of her
peanuts and had left none for her. "Don't worry," said the old woman
to the minister "Since I lost my false teeth, all I can do is suck off
the chocolate anyway."

#   Once there was an Australian, A Scotsman, and an Aboriginee.
And they were driving along the Highway in Australia, when suddenly a
Kangaroo bounded across the road. The car being so close, hit the 'roo
and the occupants were killed. So they rose toward the heavenly gate to
meet St. Peter, where they were told, "Sorry- heavens full-up, you'll
have to take a seat for a few days till we get a vacancy". The Aussie
quick to reply said, "Oh jeez Pete'... Look, I'll give 'ya 50 bucks,
if you let me go back to earth". St Peter thought about this for a
while, and said "Yeah fair enough- off you go".
   Back at the car crash the Aussie peeled himself off the ground to
the amazement of the police who'd come to the scene. The first cop
said, "Eh, strewth... You've been dead for almost half and hour- what
the hell happened???". The aussie explained the fifty dollars and the
deal to return to earth. The cop thought for a while and said,
"Well... Where are the other two?". "Oh yeah", said the Aussie, "Well
the scot's trying to bargain down to 20 bucks, and the aboriginee
thinks the government should pay for it!!!"

#An unemployed male was walking down the street feeling pretty starved,
since the last thing he had to eat was a few days ago, so he's getting
fairly desperate for some food. Eventually, he comes to a cafe and he
stops and stares in through the window. Right by the window there's a
man reading a newspaper, with a big bowl of spaghetti sitting on the
table in front of him. The man is too busy reading the newspaper and
he hasn't even touched his spaghetti, so the starving fella decides to
take a chance and grab it before anyone notices what's going on.
He goes into the cafe, sits down opposite the man, and slowly slides
the bowl of spaghetti over to his side.
The man is still reading the newspaper and doesn't notice a thing, so
the starving fella starts eating the spaghetti. He gets about halfway
through it when he suddenly sees there's a maggot-riddled rat in the
bowl. It's such a disgusting sight the bloke just throws up until all
the spaghetti is back in the bowl. The man across the table puts down
his paper and says; "Yeah, that's how far I got too!"

#Although we are living in what may be termed the steam era
and our Navy is a steam navy, I have in his work wholly excluded
the consideration of steam power, as, owing to the great cost
of coal and the impossibility of providing stowage for it
except to a limited extent, the application of steam power for
ordinary purposes must be strictly auxiliary and subordinate
and its emplyment in general service the exception rather than

    You had to go to the toilet                      9 times

On the 36 occasions that I did succeed, the activity was not entirely
satisfactory because 6 times you just lay there, 8 times you reminded
me there was a crack in the ceiling, 14 times you told me to hurry up
and get it over with, 7 times I had to wake you to tell you I had
finished and once I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move.
@Your loving husband.
#To my dear husband:

I think you have things a little confused.  Here are the real reasons
you did not get more than you did.

    Came home drunk and tried to screw the cat       7 times
    Didn't come home                                29 times
    Didn't come                                     14 times
    Came too soon                                   26 times
    Went soft before you got in                     18 times
    Toes in cramp                                    9 times
    Working late                                    49 times
    Said you had a rash, probably from a loo seat   21 times
    In a fight, someone kicked you in the balls      4 times
    Caught it in your zip                            6 times
    Got a cold, your nose keeps running             14 times
    Brewer's droop                                  95 times
    Tea was too hot, you burnt your tongue           9 times
    Had a splinter in your finger                    4 times
    Lost the notion after thinking about it all day 13 times
    Came in your pyjamas while reading a dirty book  8 times

Of the times we did get together, the reason I lay still was because
you had missed and was stuffing the sheets.  I wasn't talking about a
crack in the ceiling, what I said was "Would you prefer it on your back
or with me kneeling?"  The times you felt me move were because you had
farted and I was trying to breathe.  However, 6 months ago I phoned
Alcoholics Anonymous for help and their representative has been
calling most afternoons.
