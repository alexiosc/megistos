	  RRRRzzzz (Receive ZMODEM) receives one or more files with the
	  ZMODEM protocol.  Pathnames are supplied by the sending
	  program, and directories are made if necessary (and
	  possible).  Normally,	the "rz" command is automatically
	  issued by the	calling	ZMODEM program,	but defective ZMODEM
	  implementations may require starting _r_z manually.

	  RRRRbbbb receives file(s) with YMODEM, accepting either standard
	  128 byte sectors or 1024 byte	sectors	(Pro-YAM/ZCOMM sb ----kkkk
	  option).  The	user should determine when the 1024 byte block
	  length actually improves throughput.

	  If True YMODEM (Omen Technology trademark) file information
	  (file	length,	etc.) is received, the file length controls
	  the number of	bytes written to the output dataset, and the
	  modify time and file mode (iff non zero) are set
	  accordingly.

	  If True YMODEM file information is not received, slashes in
	  the pathname are changed to underscore, and any trailing
	  period in the	pathname is eliminated.	 This conversion is
	  useful for files received from CP/M and other	historical
	  systems.

	  RRRRcccc receives a	single _f_i_l_e with XMODEM-CRC or XMODEM-1k-CRC
	  protocol.  The user should determine when the	1024 byte
	  block	length actually	improves throughput without causing
	  problems.  The user must supply the file name	to both
	  sending and receiving	programs.  Up to 1023 garbage
	  characters may be added to the received file.

	  standard set of commands suitable for	all terminal servers.

	  Escaping control characters (sz -e) may help if the transfer
	  gets stuck in	the same place on every	attempt.
	  Professional-YAM and ZCOMM allow selection of	which control
	  characters need to be	escaped.  In extreme cases 7-bit

	  Flow control between the server and modem is often
	  defective.  This rarely causes a problem in interactive
	  applications whose short bursts (a screenfull	at most) fit
	  within the available memory buffers.	Streaming protocols
	  such as YMODEM-g, long packet	SuperKermit, and ZMODEM	can
	  overload the available buffering.  Some terminal servers
	  support commands to enable hardware flow control such	as
	  "TERM	FLOWCONTROL HARDWARE IN	OUT"; this assumes the modem
	  attached to the server is properly configured.

	  If the terminal server is too	brain damaged to support flow
	  control, you can fake	it with	ZMODEM.	 Try "sz -
	  w1024	file..." to enable software flow control. Experiment
	  with different values	to find	the best throughput.

	  Terminal servers are designed	to accept keyboard input from
	  human	operators.  They may lose data when a program sends
	  data to the host faster than humans type.  Some servers
	  allow	larger input buffers to	support	file uploads.  If you
	  can upload short files (less than 100	bytes) but not longer
	  files, try "sz -w1024	file..." with your uploading program.
	  (Not all programs support this option; use ZCOMM or
	  Professional-YAM.)

	  When both flow control and character transparency are
	  problems, use	"sz -ew1024 file..." as	a starting point.

	  Sometimes the	terminal server	software is defective and must
	  be upgraded.	Please contact the network's vendor for
	  corrective procedures.  An alternative is to install direct
	  serial ports for users desiring to upload files.

	  Some systems enforce a timeout which disconnects a user
	  after	several	minutes	of no keyboarding.  This can cause
	  problems in long, error free ZMODEM transfers.  Restricting
	  the window size with a "-w8192" option provides terminal
	  input	at regular intervals even when no error	correction is
	  needed.  If problems persist,	try setting a packet length

	  ZMODEM's support of XOFF/XON flow control allows proper
	  operation in many environments that do not support XMODEM
	  uploads.  Unfortunately, not all Unix	versions support input
	  flow control.	 The TTY input buffering on some systems may
	  not adequately buffer	long blocks or streaming input at high
	  speed.  You should suspect this problem when you can't send
	  data to the Unix system at high speeds using ZMODEM,
	  YMODEM-1k or XMODEM-1k, but YMODEM with 128 byte blocks
	  works	properly.

	  The DSZ or Pro-YAM zzzzmmmmooooddddeeeemmmm llll numeric parameter	may be set to
	  a value between 64 and 1024 to limit the burst length
	  ("zmodem pl128").  Although this compromises ZMODEM's
	  throughput, ZMODEM's superior	reliability remains intact.

	  If a program that does not properly implement	the specified
	  file transfer	protocol causes	_r_z to "hang" the port after a
	  failed transfer, either wait for _r_z to time out or keyboard
	  a dozen Ctrl-X characters.  Every reported instance of this
	  problem has been corrected by	using ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, DSZ, or
	  other	program	with a correct implementation of the specified
	  protocol.

	  Many programs	claiming to support YMODEM only	support	XMODEM
	  with 1k blocks, and they often don't get that	quite right.

	  In the case of a few poorly designed microcomputers, sending
	  serial data to a tty port at sustained high speeds has been
	  known	to cause lockups, system halts,	kernel panics, and
	  occasional antisocial	behaviour.  This problem is not	unique
	  to _r_z; newer versions	of Kermit, CRT terminals with screen
	  transmission,	and line noise have the	same effect.  When
	  experimenting	with high speed	input to a system, consider
	  rebooting the	system if the file transfers are not
	  successful, especially if the	personality of the system
	  appears altered.

	  The Unix "ulimit" parameter must be set high enough to
	  permit large file transfers to Unix.

	  Telebit modems must not be set to "spoof" UUCP, XMODEM,
	  YMODEM, or KERMIT.  Setting one of these spoofing modes
	  interferes with other	protocols.  Telebit's YMODEM spoofing
	  interferes with YMODEM transfers.
