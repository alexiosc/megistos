# MEGISTOS BBS TELECONFERENCE PLUG-IN CONFIGURATION FILE
#
# This file specifies plugins (teleconference sub-modules) to make
# available to users.
#
# The format is as follows:
#
# Everything after '#' is a considered a comment and ignored. 
#
# plugin <keyword>
# exec <filename>
# key <key>
# descr <description>
#
# plugin ...
#
# Keyword is the word used in the teleconferences to address this plugin.
# This keyword must be unique among normal teleconference commands and
# actions and at most 15 characters long. If, for example, the keyword was
# 'CHESS', the user would enter commands to the plugin by writing
# "CHESS blah blah" whereupon the plug-in would wake up and handle the rest
# of the user's input ("blah blah").
#
# Filename is the fully qualified filename of the plugin executable (e.g.
# /usr/local/bbs/bin/telecon.chess).
#
# Key is the key required for a user to access the plugin. It's an integer
# in the range 0-129 as usual. 0 means 'no key' (all users have access).
# Keys 1-128 are the normal 128 Megistos keys. Key 129 is possessed by
# user ID Sysop alone.
#
# Description is a short (up to 63 characters) description of the plugin.
# You may specify multiple 'descr' keywords. The first one will be used
# with language #1, the second with #2, etc.
