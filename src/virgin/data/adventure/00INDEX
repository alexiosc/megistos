# This file defines the adventures available to the user
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.#
#
# Lines beginning with a ':' in the FIRST column should contain the filename
# of a game file, then some white space, then the description of the game.
# The description may be of arbitrary length, but keep it short! Subsequent
# lines will be considered continuations of the description and appended to
# it, unless of course they start with a ':', in which case they're new game
# definition lines.
#
# Only options for which a file (gzip compressed or not) exists will be
# shown to the user.
#
# Sorting is by increasing title in librarian style (initial articles
# ignored). It is taken care of by the module.

# All the game entries below are commented out. The games themselves are not
# distributed here for obvious reasons of copyright (most of them are
# freeware, but not necessary according to the rules of the GPL). Feel free
# to download them from the usual places. If you don't know what the usual
# places are, search the WWW for 'Interactive Fiction'.
#
# Put downloaded files in this directory. You can compress them with gzip if
# you feel like saving some space. The virtual machine will decompress them
# temporarily. Uncomment the respective entry below or create a new one, and
# you're set!
