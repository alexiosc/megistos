	This directory contains the fixemail utility. 
	
There has appeared to be a bug, somewhere in Megistos functions, so that
there is difference between the last message read index (in the quickscan
entry), and the actual last message index update every time a new message
has arrived for the user. So, new messages have smaller index number than
the index in quickscan (so that they never appear as new messages!).

	This utility, updates the last message pointer of the user quickscan
record, to a selected value. The messge pointer is *only* updated if the
index read from the file is greater than the index given.

USAGE:
	fixemail [-q] [-d] [-f] [-m value] userid

If -m parameter is ommitted then only information about the user record are
reported.

The -q parameter enables 'quiet' mode.
The -d parameter enables debug information (no output if in 'quiet' mode).
The -f parameter forces update even if message pointer is less than the
	index given! (******** USE WITH CARE ********)
