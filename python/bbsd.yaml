# MODEM TYPES
#
###############################################################################

# Keys:
#
# hangup_on_startup: if True, set the baud rate of the TTY to 0 on
#   initialisation. This causes the kernel to hang up the line. Hopefully. If
#   False, the modem is just initialised. The default is True, and it can't
#   hurt on most smart modems.
#
# bps_lock: if True, the serial port speed won't be changed to match the modem
#   connection speed. This is used for MNP 5 (data-compressing) modems where
#   the computer-to-modem speed must be higher than the modem-to-remote-modem
#   speed to take advantage of compression. The default is True because you
#   probably aren't using a pre-MNP 5 device.
#
# initial: a list of TERMIOS options to set prior to initialisation. Prepend a
#   - to clear.
#
# final: a list of TERMIOS options to set once the connection is
#   established. If left out, no changes are made. Speed specifications (B38400
#   etc) will only be honoured if bps_lock is True or if the the speed could
#   not be discovered from the incoming_call_script. Note that once this is
#   done, the BBS session will put the terminal in raw mode, potentially
#   changing some of these options.
#
# init_script: a list of key-value singletons specifying a modem initialisation
#   script. The following keys and values are available:
#
#   - wait: SECONDS  -- wait this many seconds. Decimal numbers can be used.
#
#   - send: STRING -- send this string. Use \r\n to end lines for safety.
#
#   - expect: REGEXP -- the modem's response must match this regular
#                       expression.  If the regular expression doesn't match,
#                       initialisation has failed and will be re-attempted.
#
#   - timeout: SECONDS -- set the timeout in seconds for subsequent expect
#                         instructions. The script is considered a failure on
#                         timeout.
#
# incoming_call_script: similar to init_script, after initialisation this
#   script is executed to detect incoming calls. The script MUST start with an
#   ‘expect’ instruction. Any ‘send’ instructions before the first ‘expect’
#   instruction will be ignored. Regular expressions in this script may
#   contains named capture groups with the following names:
#
#   - caller_id -- to capture the number of the caller.
#
#   - speed -- to capture the speed of the connection.  This is required if
#     bps_lock is False, otherwise the serial port speed won't change to match
#     the modem connection speed.

# DEFINE BBS ‘CHANNELS’
#
###############################################################################

# Each channel can fit one user. A channel can be a modeo, serial port, or a
# pseudo-TTY representing a connection from the Internet. As such, channels are
# now dynamic and configured using regular expressions.
#
# Megistos allowed up to 256 channels using two-digit hexadecimal numbers. The
# format is superficially identical to the 00-63 channels of The Major BBS
# 5.xx.
#
# These channels are freeform strings, but we like to keep them short. (1-4
# characters, haven't decided yet).
#
# For modem and hardware serial lines, we can use static strings instead of
# regular expressions.

channels:
  - modems:
      match_re: '/dev/tty([SUC])(|SB|CM)(.+)'
      name: '{0}{2:>03}'
      modem_type: zyxel_u1496e
        
  - pseudottys:
      match_re: '/dev/pts/(.+)'
      name: 'P{:>03x}'
      baud: 0

  - everything_else:
      match_re: '^.*/(.*)'
