.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Output flags. These flags control the behaviour of the low-level output subsystem.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCOFL_ANSIENABLE\fP. If this flag is set, ANSI output is enabled. Actually, the flag works the other way round: if it's clear, ANSI directives are stripped from all output.
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCOFL_WAITTOCLEAR\fP. Set to indicate that, if a clear screen ANSI directive is received, and this does not happen \fIimmediately\fP a user input request, a screen pause will be forced. This is done to make sure that the user can see all output of the system. If even a single character (even white space or ANSI directives) has been output to the user between the user's last input and the screen clear, the pause will be forced. For that reason, try to place clear screen directives at the top of message prompts.
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCOFL_AFTERINPUT\fP. Set by the low-level input subsystem to indicate that user input has just been received. This is used, among other things, in co-operation with the flag above to generate screen pauses.
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCOFL_INHIBITVARS\fP. Substitution variables are variables enclosed in at-signs. These variables will be replaced by their value before being printed. For instance, you can issue the name of the BBS by using \fC@BBS@\fP, and the current time using \fC@TIME@\fP. Setting this flag inhibits interpretation of at-signs as variable delimiters. Effectively, no variable substitution will occur. This is useful as a security measure. You certainly don't want users to be able to use substitution variables in their messages or pages. It could be used by crackers to confuse people or for `social engineering'.
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCOFL_PROTECTVARS\fP. If the above flag is clear, you can set this flag to partially inhibit variable substitution to \fIonly\fP system prompts. Expansion in user-contributed material will not occur.
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCOFL_ISBOT\fP. Set to mark a non-human user of the system. Output is reformatted for easier parsing by scripts, AIs etc and output in a nice, easily parsable format. You shouldn't need to touch this flag. It's set by the BBS library whenever needed.
